2020 NASCAR Gander RV and Outdoors Truck Race Eight Texas


36 trucks will take the green flag this evening.  Sheldon Creed	(2) and Grant Enfinger (98) start on the front row.  Kyle 'KyBu' Busch (51) is in tonight's field.  I wonder if he will spank the field as usual, or if we will have a decent race.  The stages are 40-40-87.<!--more-->

Kyle crossed the finish line first, but was disqualified in the Xfinity series race after his car failed post-race inspection for height requirement compliance.

Why would you go with an in-car camera shot while the race is split-screen with a commercial and the race split is smaller than the advert split; inane camera shot selection.

Congrats to Matt Crafton (88), Stewart Friesen (52), and Brett Moffitt (23) on finishing third, fourth, and fifth respectively.

The race was largely uneventful, but occasionally competitive, so it wasn't painful to watch.  I wouldn't say it was a great race, but it wasn't a bad race either.  The Kyle Busch Motorsports trucks seemed head-and-shoulders better than the rest of the field.  Zane Smith was competitive for a while and I hoped he would give them a run at the end, but a late pit stop demolished that possibility.  I expected a better race until I saw that Kyle Busch was in the field.  The race wasn't nearly as bad as most KyBu driving clinics - so that's something.

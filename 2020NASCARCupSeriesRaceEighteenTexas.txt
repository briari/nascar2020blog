This race was boring.  It wasn't as boring as expected, but pretty boring.  The leader would drive away from the field and it seemed to take 10 to 20 laps for any one to catch and pass the leader. Since the end of the race was a two lap run there wasn't much opportunity for a battle for the lead. This is a track that proves that mile-and-a-half package needs improvement.  Instead of worrying about rearranging tracks, improving the package would actually solve the problem.  The races are only too long when they're too boring like this one.  The 1.5 mile package needs to allow for side-by-side racing and passing and short-run as well as long-run speed.  It also needs to allow for strategy variations and for the unexpected - tire issues, engine issues, fuel issues and the unimaginable.

I'm also tired of seeing the lucky wins.  Occasional lucky/strategy wins are okay - but with the other races being monopolized by the usual suspects, wins like today's are disappointing when there are more talented, more deserving drivers in the field who didn't get the lucky break.  That's racing, but some days it stinks.  The past two weeks have been stinky days.

We're being subjected to video of Austin Dillon's wife Whitney and his unfortunately named son Ace.  Since they aren't in cars and I tuned in to racing, I have no interest in watching his family at home, nor in watching an NFL player's family at home during a game broadcast, nor a hockey player's family at home during a game broadcast.  It's not what I tuned in for, nor what I want to see.
